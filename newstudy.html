			<h3>Project Vision</h3>

			<p>On Jiminy, users can learn about and manage their mental health through meaningful discussions with friends and guidance from insightful resources.</p>

			<p>Jiminy provides a platform where users can explore mental wellness independently or collaboratively with trusted friends through a daily check-in in the form of a chat that is guided by an AI moderator.</p>
